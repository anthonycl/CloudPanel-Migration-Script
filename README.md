```

### Backup a Specific Site:

## üìù `settingsFetcher.php`

This script fetches site and server configurations and stores them in JSON format for backup purposes. Does not need to be called seperately outside of bash scripts, but you can if you want to.

### Usage:

1. **To Backup Site Data:**
```php
<?php
require 'settingsFetcher.php';
$settingsFetcher = new \SiteData\SettingsFetcher();
$settingsFetcher->saveSiteDataAsJSON('example.com');
```

2. **To Backup Server Data:**
```php
<?php
require 'settingsFetcher.php';
$settingsFetcher = new \SiteData\SettingsFetcher();
$settingsFetcher->saveServerDataAsJSON();
```

The data will be saved as `siteName.json` or `server.json` in the `backups` directory.
